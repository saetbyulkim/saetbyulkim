     Since I joined Dr. Balint-Kurti's lab in 2017, I worked on genetic and biochemical analysis of the maize hypersensitive defense response and the interaction between Rp1 allels and Puccinia sorghi (common rust).
   
  accomplishments:
    - Identified a maize novel foldback transposable element through map-based cloning
    - Identified signaling components involved in modulating hypersensitive cell death in maize
    - Investigated a novel and multifaceted understanding of the maize susceptible and resistance-specific responses to Puccinia sorghi
    - Identifying and characterizing effectors of Puccinia sorghi using tobacco and maize system

    To explore the resistance mechanism between pepper and potyvirus I performed functional study of the resistance gene including domain swapping, co-expression study and virus-induced gene silencing assay using Nicotiana benthamiana system in the same lab where I got my Ph.D 
  

  accomplishments:
    - A novel mechanism of Pvr4 resistance to potyvirus, Basic Science Research Program from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) (September 2016 – March 2017) (2016R1A6A3A01011640)
    - Oral Presentation, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (January 2016)
    - Oral Presentation, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Seoul National University (June 2016)

    - Performed comparative genomics of virus resistance by constructing mapping population in Solanaceae.
    - Generated new markers using NGS and RNA-Seq to identify gene.
    - Determined the role of Pvr4 against multiple potyviruses in pepper and tobacco.
    - Generated transgenic tobacco lines of Pvr4 overexpression or other resistance genes.
    - Molecular marker development, gene cloning, ligation-independent cloning (LIC), Y2H screening, Bi-FC, Southern/Northern blot, Western blot, ELISA, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), and transient assay. 

  accomplishments:
    - Outstanding Oral Presentation Award, the Korean Society for Plant Biotechnology (October 2009) 
    - National Science Fellowship from Korea Student Aid Foundation (2009–2010) (S2-2009-000-01736-1)
