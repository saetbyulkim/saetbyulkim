    My PI, 'Peter Balint-Kurti' is a professor and USDA-ARS research geneticist at NCSU.     
    Since I joined his lab in 2017, I am focusing on genetic and biochemical analysis of the maize hypersensitive defense response and the interaction between Rp1 allels and Puccinia sorghi (common rust).

    To explore the resistance mechanism between pepper and potyvirus I performed functional study of the resistance gene including domain swapping, co-expression study and virus-induced gene silencing assay using Nicotiana benthamiana system in the same lab where I got my Ph.D

    - Performed comparative genomics of virus resistance by constructing mapping population in Solanaceae.
    - Generated new markers using NGS and RNA-Seq to identify gene.
    - Determined the role of Pvr4 against multiple potyviruses in pepper and tobacco.
    - Generated transgenic tobacco lines of Pvr4 overexpression or other resistance genes.
    - Molecular marker development, gene cloning, ligation-independent cloning (LIC), Y2H screening, Bi-FC, Southern/Northern blot, Western blot, ELISA, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), and transient assay. 

  accomplishments:
    - Outstanding Oral Presentation Award, the Korean Society for Plant Biotechnology (October 2009) 
    - National Science Fellowship from Korea Student Aid Foundation (2009–2010) (S2-2009-000-01736-1)
