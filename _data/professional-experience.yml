    My PI, 'Peter Balint-Kurti' is a professor and USDA-ARS research geneticist at NCSU.     
    Since I joined his lab in 2017, I am focusing on genetic and biochemical analysis of the maize hypersensitive defense response and the interaction between Rp1 allels and Puccinia sorghi (common rust).

    To explore the resistance mechanism between pepper and potyvirus I performed functional study of the resistance gene including domain swapping, co-expression study and virus-induced gene silencing assay using Nicotiana benthamiana system in the same lab where I got my Ph.D 
  

  accomplishments:
    - A novel mechanism of Pvr4 resistance to potyvirus, Basic Science Research Program from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) (September 2016 – March 2017) (2016R1A6A3A01011640)

    1.	Genetic analysis of resistance pepper against potyvirus: Performed comparative genetics/genomics of virus resistance by constructing mapping population in Solanaceae.
    2.	Genome-based cloning of Pvr4: Generated new markers using NGS and RNA-Seq to identify gene.
    3.	Pvr4 characterization: Determined the role of Pvr4 against multiple potyviruses in pepper and tobacco.
    4.	Tissue culture: Generated transgenic tobacco lines of Pvr4 overexpression or other resistance genes.
    5.	Molecular techniques: molecular marker development, gene cloning, ligation-independent cloning (LIC), Y2H screening, Bi-FC, Southern/Northern blot, Western blot, ELISA, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), and transient assay. 

  accomplishments:
